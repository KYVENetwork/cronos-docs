# Acquire or Bridge TCRO

## How to acquire TCRO (Test CRO)

### Testnet Faucet

To interact with Cronos zkEVM Testnet, simply use the test-token [faucet](https://zkevm-t0.cronos.org/faucet) to obtain TCRO tokens and pay for gas on the chain.

In order to use the faucet, you need an Ethereum-style wallet address (starting with 0x). See how to connect a wallet: [connect-a-crypto-wallet.md](connect-a-crypto-wallet.md "mention")
