# Introduction to Cronos zkEVM Chain testnet



In December 2023, [Cronos Labs](https://cronoslabs.org), the web3 start-up accelerator focusing on DeFi, GameFi, and the development of the [Cronos](https://cronos.org) ecosystem, announced the launch of Cronos zkEVM Chain public testnet, a zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup blockchain network that represents a significant milestone on Cronos' journey towards scalability and mainstream adoption.

The testnet is a chain using [ZK Stack](https://zkstack.io/), launched in a partnership between Cronos Labs, Matter Labs, the team behind [zkSync](https://zksync.io/), and engineering teams from [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com), [VVS Finance](https://vvs.finance/), [Fulcrom Finance](https://fulcrom.finance/en/) and [Veno Finance](https://veno.finance/).

It uses the latest [Boojum](https://zksync.mirror.xyz/HJ2Pj45EJkRdt5Pau-ZXwkV2ctPx8qFL19STM5jdYhc) STARK-based zero-knowledge proof system, which in addition to its  ability to run on GPUs with as little as 16 GB of RAM, boasts [amongst the lowest fees](https://l2fees.info/) of any layer 2 rollup, with further cost optimizations planned in the near future.

The network uses TCRO, a testnet version of the $CRO cryptocurrency of the Cronos ecosystem, as its native token to pay for transaction fees, but it can also support fee payment in any cryptocurrency thanks to zkSync's native account abstraction implemented at the protocol level.

This is the first live public testnet utilizing [ZK Stack](https://era.zksync.io/docs/reference/concepts/hyperscaling.html), [ a modular, open-source framework leveraging zkSyncâ€™s code, that is designed to build custom ZK-powered L2s and L3s (referred to as hyperchains)](https://era.zksync.io/docs/reference/concepts/hyperscaling.html). Hyperchains are fractal-like instances of zkEVM networks running in parallel and with a common settlement on the Ethereum mainnet.In 2024, hyperchains will adopt a shared native bridge to Ethereum mainnet as well as unified interchain messaging, which will make it possible for users to send tokens, messages or transactions across hyperchains while benefiting from the security of the Ethereum network.

As part of internal performance benchmarks, hyperchain technology can already deliver in excess of 100 transactions per second, with significant performance improvements planned for the coming months. The community is invited to run additional tests on this newly launched testnet and share them with the [Cronos community](https://discord.com/invite/cronos).

All developers are warmly invited to experiment with the Cronos zkEVM Chain testnet. Please read this section for details about the architecture and getting started resources.
