# FAQs for ERC20-only transaction Support

#### I transferred CRO from the other centralised exchanges (CEXs) to the Crypto.com Defi Desktop wallet, but why it is not showing up in my Crypto.com DeFi Desktop Wallet?

Some centralised exchanges currently only support Ethereum Mainnet ERC20-CRO withdrawal, while the Crypto.com DeFi Desktop Wallet only supports Cronos POS Chain & Cronos Chain for the moment, thus you're not able to view any ERC20 assets or balances of Ethereum Chain on the Desktop Wallet. It is highly recommended that all users check the networks before making the withdrawal and always begin with a small amount to make sure the transfer actually works.

#### I have already made the transfer from the centralised exchange that does not support Cronos Chain to my Crypto.com DeFi Desktop Wallet. What should I do to retrieve my funds?

* Here's what you could do:

1. Send some ETH (around 0.03 ETH) to your `0x..` address for paying the transaction gas fee on Ethereum.
2. Download our Crypto.com App, and register an account (skip this if you're already a user)
3. Send your ERC20-CRO to the Crypto.com App ERC20-CRO deposit address\*
4. When you get your CRO, withdraw your CRO to your ledger address (MAKE SURE YOU SELECT Cronos Chain) `0x..` address
5. You would be able to see your funds on Crypto.com DeFi Desktop Wallet afterwards

* Other than this, it is also possible that there is no Ethereum in your wallet, which could result in your funds getting stuck as you aren't able to pay for the Ethereum gas fee. Please ensure you have enough ETH for the transaction.

_For step 3 of transferring your ERC20-CRO, you could either use MetaMask or Ledger Live (for ledger user) to send ERC20-CRO from your Ledger to Crypto.com App. Take the wallet on MetaMask as an example, if you log into the same wallet on MetaMask and switch the network to the Ethereum mainnet on MetaMask, you would be able to access those ERC20 tokens in this wallet on MetaMask. After that, you would be free to transfer the funds to the Crypto.com app then withdraw them to the Cronos network._

#### I would like to send ERC20-CRO from Crypto.com App or DeFi Wallet to the other CEXs directly. Is this possible?

Please make sure both sender and receiver accounts support ERC20 format. Only if the other CEXs support ERC20-CRO can you send it. Users may refer to this guide for more details:

* [Difference between ERC-20 CRO and native CRO](https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/5019195-send-and-receive-cro-the-difference-between-native-cro-and-erc20-cro)
* [CRO deposit/withdrawal information](https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/4970776-cro-deposit-withdrawal-information-in-crypto-com-app)

#### I made a transaction on MetaMask (through Cronos network) to another CEX that does not support Cronos Network. How can I retrieve it back?

In this case, only the owner of the receiving account has access to that funds. You could also check if your transaction is successful/confirmed on [Cronoscan](https://cronoscan.com/). Given the receiving account is from other CEXs, you may contact the receiving party and find out if it is possible for them to do a manual refund for your transaction. They may or may not do it depending on their own policies. Otherwise, you will most likely not be able to access the funds until that CEX starts to support Cronos.
